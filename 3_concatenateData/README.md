# README - Concatenating and formatting DataFrames

Written on July 22, 2021 by Adam Spierer

The purpose of this documentation is to outline the script used to concatenate and format the outputs from each flight assay image into a singular DataFrame.

## Running 3\_concatenateData.py script

The script requires the user to specify the directory containing the csv files from the previous step, and a directory to save the final output file.

It requires the user to provide the conversion factor for going from pixels to meters (usually in the high hundreds to low thousands range), and the column names corresponding with the experimental details saved in the file name.

This script reads the individual csv files generated by FIJI into separate DataFrames and assigns the specific experimental details listed in the file name to separate columns. Y-positions are converted to meters fallen ( )(1 - Y) / pixels\_to\_meters ). Groupby functions are applied to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and counts for each image in the data set, which are then merged into a single DataFrame and saved as `results.csv`.

To run, enter:
`python3 <path to 3_concatenateData.py>`

By this point, the user should have a complete set of results for their entire experiment. All that is left to do now is data visualization and statistical analysis, but those are specific to an individual experiment.
